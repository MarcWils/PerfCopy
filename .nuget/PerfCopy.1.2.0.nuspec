        <description>Extension methods providing high performance deep copy capability for of arrays of common value types - currently: byte, char, short, int, long, and their unsigned brethren where applicable.
Considerably faster than Array.Copy - and it's also faster than Buffer.BlockCopy in most situations!

High-performance enabled through use of optimised 'unsafe' blocks.

This package could be a good addition to other packages if you're building in copying of some kind that would benefit from being fast.</description>
        <summary>Deep copy arrays of value types really quickly (considerably faster than BCL-provided methods, at no cost to usability).</summary>
        <releaseNotes>Added additional methods to some types to harmonise them. Now all types have equivalent functionality.

Exposed a performance copying method, for those who might want to use it (running with scissors warning applies: method uses 'unsafe' techniques with pointer-arithmetic, so bad things can happen if one is careless. You have been duly warned!)</releaseNotes>
